This is a vagrant test harness for development of puppet-zfsonlinux

Testing:

To test the zfs and zpool providers, you can use puppet resource. In
order for puppet resource to see the custom providers, you have to
specify the modulepath like so:

puppet resource --modulepath=/tmp/vagrant-puppet/modules-0/ zpool
